# Rainbow Scrapbook
This is a user interface for exploring brilliantly colored collections of objects.
 
Each section shows objects of all the same color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple), and navigating through the color wheel cycles through all the colors. My inspirations are natural collections in museums and I Spy books from the 90â€™s. All objects here are table-top sized objects from in and around my home.

This project uses the Masonry cascading grid layout library by David Desandro and the CSS conic gradient polyfill by Lea Verou.
