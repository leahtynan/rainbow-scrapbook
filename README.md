# Rainbow Scrapbook
Digital scrapbook with pages for six colors.
 
This is a project idea from 2016 that I'm reviving and building out in a more flexible manner. The concept is a digital scrapbook where each section shows objects of all the same color, and navigating through the color wheel cycles through all the colors. My original idea was for the collections to be animals, but I decided to change it to all table-top-sized objects so I can collect my own images rather than need to purchase images. My inspirations are natural collections in museums and I Spy books from the 90â€™s.

In my 2016 prototype, I had an HTML page for each color. For this new version, my plan is to store the data about each color (object file names, color name, etc.) in a JSON file and use it to re-load the visuals each time the user navigates to a new color.

This work-in-progress uses several external resources: the Masonry cascading grid layout library by David Desandro, the CSS conic gradient polyfill by Lea Verou, jQuery, and Modernizr. I'm unsure whether I'll continue using them.

I'm working on gathering and editing all the images with the help of one of my artist friends. I made sure to photograph a yellow, orange, and red leaf while we were in peak foliage in Boston!
